# About
Build a chat application with a sign-in system with Node.js and Express.js.

To implement the sign-in system safely, I learned about authentication. This is the act of verifying the identity of a person or process.

In this course, I learned how to use Passport to manage authentication, Pug to create reusable templates for quickly building the front end, and web sockets for real-time communication between the clients and server.

## How to run
Use the sample.env as reference. Make your own .env file and fill out the empty variables.

Use the command:

  npm install && npm run start

open http://localhost:3000/ in the web browser.
